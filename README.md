# wta-db
(+ scraper)

Creating a db of all 3897 hikes listed by the WTA via scraping their site. 
In an attempt to be at least slightly respectful, maximum rate is 1 request / second.
Code was initially created as a jupyter notebook, and includes bonus code to scrape all trip reports (which I decided would take way too long to run).

Original intent was to find all hikes with washed out roads for potential bikepacking adventures.
